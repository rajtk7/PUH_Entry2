## Custom Activities - Excel, PDF & Notepad Functionalities

## Inspiration

Automation technologies of any kind have been disrupting industries for decades to date. The technological improvements during the 19th century have had great impact on human life, yet most of the innovation was limited to substitute human strength and dexterity. New disruptive technologies such as Artiﬁcial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation enable a by far larger scope of automation eﬀorts. Robotic Process Automation enables organizations to deploy software robots that are able to execute manual tasks across any existing application. Suitable processes to be automated by software robots are often repetitive, highly standardized and rule-based. Yet, Robotic Process Automation has the potential to automate a wider range of processes if it utilizes cognitive capabilities through Artiﬁcial Intelligence.

This is a first step to cognitive capabilities within a robot by implementing a advanced Functions.

## What it does

The goal of this custom activity is to create a Pivot Table (Summarising the data) and Filter the data without writing any lengthy coding.Find & Replace, Update Status and much more functions.

**Input**

In all the fields watermark is given by looking at that you will come to know that what exactly you have to type in it.

## How we built it

Built in Visual Studio using C# implementing a CodeActivity.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Really without writing any lengthy code if you are getting the expected things done then obvioulsy it's a great achievement. As i saw UiPath forum that most of the developers were struggled to get the Pivot table output and filtering an data and for other functions which i have developed.

## What we learned

We have learned the ease of implementing custom code into Custom Activities for UiPath. Thanks to UiPath who has given us this oppurtunity to play with Activities. There is no limitation and restriction. If we have skills then we can do wonders.

## What's next for Pivot Table & Filter Range -  Activity

1. To make the UiPath Tool more popular.
2. Developer job so easy, user- friendly.


## Background information

To make developer's job so easy which satisfies our main objective of this custom UiPath activity.
